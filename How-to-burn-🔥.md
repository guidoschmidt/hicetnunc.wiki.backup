**Important:** _You need to [cancel] the swap of the OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it._

3. If the burn button is not working, you can send the OBJKT to a burn wallet address directly from your Tezos wallet. The address is: `tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX`. The burn wallet is an wall that nobody owns a key of. Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, that's why you can't "delete" it, you can only send it to another wallet.
