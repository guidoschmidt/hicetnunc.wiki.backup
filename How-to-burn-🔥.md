### **burn**

2: _(verb)_ to "delete" your OBJKT


***

3. If the burn button is not working, you can send the OBJKT to a burn wallet address directly from your Tezos wallet. The address is: `tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX`. The burn wallet is an wall that nobody owns a key of. Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, that's why you can't "delete" it, you can only send it to another wallet. 

**Important:** _You need to [cancel] the curation of this OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it._


### **troubleshoot**
**Important:** _If someone buys one of your editions, even if you burn the rest of them, the objkt won't disappear from your profile_
