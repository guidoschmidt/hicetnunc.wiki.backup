### **burn**

2: _(verb)_ to "delete" your OBJKT


***

1. Make sure you are synced.
2. Press the burn button. In your wallet, the OBJKT should should up as being transferred to the burn wallet.
3. If the burn button is not working, you can send the OBJKT to a burn wallet address directly from your Tezos wallet. The address is: `tz1burnburnburnburnburnburnburjAYjjX`. The burn address is an address nobody owns a key of. Transactions on the blockchain are irreversible, that's why you can't "delete" it, you can only send it to another wallet. 

### **troubleshoot**
**Important:** _You need to [cancel] the curation of this OBJKT so it can be available in your wallet when you are ready to burn it._
**Important:** _If someone buys one of your editions, even if you burn the rest of them, the objkt won't disappear from your profile_
