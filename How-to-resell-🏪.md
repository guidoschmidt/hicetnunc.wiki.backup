How to place your OBJKT on the secondary market.

***


1. Make sure your wallet is synced.
2. Head over to your [Collections] and click on the OBJKT.
3. Click on the [collectors] tab to see all of the owners and sellers.
4. Click on [swap] and set a price for your OBJKT.

_IMPORTANT: Once swapping something up for sale, it is sent to the H=N escrow wallet while it is "on the market". Therefore, the OBJKT will disappear from your collections. Don't worry, its still up for sale! We are working on a market view fix for this._
