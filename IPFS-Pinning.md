Your OBJKTs are uploaded by H=N "off-chain" to The Interplanetary File System, or IPFS. The Tezos contract stores the references to the IPFS hash of the art and to other metadata like title and description.

## What is IPFS and why is IPFS pinning important?
"_The Interplanetary File System, or [IPFS](https://www.ipfs.com/), is a distributed storage network made up of “nodes” or computers all over the world where people and apps are storing and sharing data. When an IPFS node retrieves data from the network it keeps a local cache of that data for future usage, taking up space on that particular IPFS node. IPFS nodes frequently clear this cache out in order to make room for new content..._" —[source](https://medium.com/pinata/what-is-an-ipfs-pinning-service-f6ed4cd7e475)

## Why does data on IPFS need to be pinned?

According to IPFS, "_IPFS has a fairly aggressive caching mechanism that will keep an object local for a short time after you perform any IPFS operation on it, but these objects may get garbage-collected regularly. To prevent that garbage collection, simply pin the CID you care about_". —[source](https://docs.ipfs.io/how-to/pin-files/)

## Does H=N pin my OBJKTs for me?

Metadata & OBJKT files are uploaded & pinned in Infura [(see github code here)](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/blob/main/src/data/ipfs.js#L12), and then they're downloaded from ipfs.io, cloudflare or pinata public gateways [(see github code here)](https://github.com/hicetnunc2000/hicetnunc/blob/main/src/pages/objkt-display/tabs/info.js#L11).

## Do I need to pin my own OBJKTs?

This is a personal decision. Since H=N pins content for you, you could say that it is safe, but some people would prefer to be in control of their data. For the very long-term, it is important to understand that you are responsible for the artwork as an artist and collector. It is also important to keep in mind the idea of "content persistence". "IPFS ensures that content cannot change over time without a clear record and solves the issue of URLs not resolving." You can read a good article regarding content persistence by Filecoin blog [here](https://filecoin.io/blog/posts/ipfs-filecoin-and-content-persistence/).

"When you “pin” data on an IPFS node, you are telling that node that the data is important and it should be saved. Pinning prevents important data from being deleted from your node when the clearing process happens. However, you can only control and pin data on your node(s). You can not force other nodes on the IPFS network to pin your content for you. So, to guarantee your content stays pinned, you have to run your own IPFS nodes." — [source](https://medium.com/pinata/what-is-an-ipfs-pinning-service-f6ed4cd7e475)
